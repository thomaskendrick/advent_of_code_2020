# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2020 - Thomas Kendrick :gift:

My attempt at Advent of Code 2019 in Rust. Thanks to [Gr√©gory Obanos](https://github.com/gobanos) for the [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) crate used to make running and benchmarking solutions straightforward so I can focus on the implementation.

## Setup instructions

1) Install cargo-aoc cli using by running the command `cargo install cargo-aoc`
2) Clone this repo.
3) From the root directory run `cargo aoc` to run the latest implemented day. (You can specify a day/part using the `-d {day}` and `-p {part}` options. To run benchmarks run `cargo aoc bench` (Use the `-o` flag to open a plot in the browser)
